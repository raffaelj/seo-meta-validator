The property <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/populationType\">populationType<\/a> is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/StatisticalPopulation\">StatisticalPopulation<\/a> representing all <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Person\">Person<\/a>s with a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/homeLocation\">homeLocation<\/a> of East Podunk California, would be described by applying the appropriate <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/homeLocation\">homeLocation<\/a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/populationType\">populationType<\/a> properties to a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/StatisticalPopulation\">StatisticalPopulation<\/a> item that stands for that set of people.The properties <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/numConstraints\">numConstraints<\/a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/constrainingProperties\">constrainingProperties<\/a> are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statisticalpopulation, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/populationType\">populationType<\/a> of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Event\">Event<\/a> or <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/NewsArticle\">NewsArticle<\/a> could be used.
